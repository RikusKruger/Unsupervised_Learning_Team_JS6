    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this context, we as EDSA students have constructucted a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this model is Root Mean Square Error. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is commonly used in regression analysis and forecasting, and measures the standard deviation of the residuals arising between predicted and actual observed values for a modelling process. For our task of generating user movie ratings via recommendation algorithms.\n",
